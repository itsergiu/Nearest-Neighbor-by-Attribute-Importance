# Nearest-Neighbor-by-Attribute-Importance
K-nearest neighbors algorithm by attribute importance.

The goal is to calculate nearest neighbor with decreasing importance of attribute from left to right. First attribute is the most important and last is the least important. To achieve this I developed following halving interval algorithm.

I want to know what solutions python libraries provides or tensorflow libraries for finding neearest neighbor by attribute importance.
